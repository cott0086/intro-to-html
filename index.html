            I actually secretly hate art. Hate might be too strong of a word, I love art very much, but I find it frustrating and the thought of doing it for the rest of my life as <strong>more</strong> than just a hobby freaks me out. I love creating, don't get me wrong, I take pride in the things I create, but the idea that I'm considered an artist and like... that's it??? It sits wrong. I think it's internalised homophobia but for art. Internalised... artistphobia. I don't really have any other skills though, so in the end, this is the best place for me to be. I know I'm not limited to just being an artist and I do have knowledge on other things but not to a degree where I can consider myself anything by it.

            Anyway, I don't have a favourite colour, I'm trying to start a mail club, and I'm currently trying to learn Japanese. So far, it's proved easier than I thought (I've barely started). I also think this program is easy. It confuses me sometimes because I'll finish an in-class assignment before anyone else and I question whether or not I did it right if everybody else is still working. But then again, maybe I'm just <strong>that</strong> good. Just kidding, that kinda made me sound super self righteous. I promise I'm not. I have a dog and I love my family, and I do have a favourite sibling. The people in my class freak me out and I've come to the conclusion that when teachers encourage you by giving you what seems to be a personalized compliment, it's the equivalent of falling in love with a stripper. Not that I'm falling in love with teachers, I'm just saying that that's not the frist time they've told someone that they're special. Regardless, I do think I'm special. #positivity
